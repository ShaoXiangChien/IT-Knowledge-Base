A company has a $20 million portfolio with a beta of 1.2. It would like to use futures contracts on a stock index to hedge its risk. The index futures price is currently standing at 1080, and each contract is for delivery of $250 times the index. What is the hedge that minimizes risk? What should the company do if it wants to reduce the beta of the portfolio to 0.6?

```
In order to hedge the portfolio risk, the portfolio manager should sell the index futures contract.

In order to completely hedge the portfolio, the no. of contracts to sell

= (Beta - Target Beta) x Portfolio Value / Index Future Value

= (1.2 - 0) x 20,000,000 / (250 x 1080)

= 89 contracts

If it wants to reduce the beta to 0.6

=> No. of contracts to sell = (1.2 - 0.6) x 20,000,000 / (250 x 1080) = 44 contracts.

“If the minimum variance hedge ratio is calculated as 1.0, the hedge must be perfect.” Is this statement true? Explain your answer.

3.11.  
“If there is no basis risk, the minimum variance hedge ratio is always 1.0.” Is this statement true? Explain your answer.

```
TRUE

Suppose for the sake of definiteness that the commodity is being purchased. If the hedge ratio is h, the gain on futures is h(F2 –F1) so that the price paid is S2 − h(F2 –F1) or hb2 + hF1+(1−h)S2. If there is no basis risk, b2 is known. For a given h, there is therefore no uncertainty in the first two terms. For any value of h other than 1, there is uncertainty in the third term. The minimum variance hedge ratio is therefore 1.

On July 1, an investor holds 50,000 shares of a certain stock. The market price is $30 per share. The investor is interested in hedging against movements in the market over the next month and decides to use an index futures contract. The index futures price is currently 1,500 and one contract is for delivery of $50 times the index. The beta of the stock is 1.3. What strategy should the investor follow? Under what circumstances will it be profitable?

```
If we hold position in stock then we take short in futures

Number of futures contracts=Number of shares*Price per share*beta/(futures contract size*futures multiplier)=50000*30*1.3/(1500*50)=26

Short 26 index futures

A company wishes to hedge its exposure to a new fuel whose price changes have a 0.6 correlation with gasoline futures price changes.The company will lose $1 million for each 1 cent increase in the price per gallon of the new fuel over the next three months.The new fuel’s price changes have a standard deviation that is 50% greater than price changes in gasoline futures prices. If gasoline futures are used to hedge the exposure, what should the hedge ratio be? What is the company’s exposure measured in gallons of the new fuel? What position, measured in gallons, should the company take in gasoline futures? How many gasoline futures contracts should be traded? Each contract is on 42,000 gallons.
