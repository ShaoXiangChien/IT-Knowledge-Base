## Main points
- *process* vs *thread*
	- process - has its own address space
	- thread - share the same address space if they're in a given process
- RPC - A stub function marshals the params, requests the remote server to do the actual work, and demarshals the reply msg as return value.
- concurrency and parallelism
	- concurrenecy - 看起來同時，實際上是overlap time period
	- parallelism - multicore / multiprocess -> 真的同時
- kernel threads - managed by OS directly but not only run in kernel mode, can be assigned to user threads
- recursive calls on a multiprocessor
- *scheduler activation* - a kernel thread is allocated to a user thread to prevent it from blocking the entire process
- kernel thread vs hardware thread
	- kernel threads may run on a given hardward thread
- `join()` vs `detach()`
	- join - main thread stop running and wait until the new thread ends
	- detach - doesn't stop the main thread, just mark it to be automatically reclaimed on termination
- `cancel` a thread is to **ask** (not force) thread to terminate itself
- Series-Parallel aka fork-join parallelism
	- serial -> fork -> join
	- e.g. MergeSort, QuickSort
- fork-join parallelism is supported in OpenMP
- RET in 8051 knows where to return to by ==finding the return address in the top two bytes of the stack==

## Terms
- overhead
- RPC - remote procedure call
- stub function
- marshal - sort, order
- PSW - program status word
- SMT architectures (simultaneous multithreading)
-
